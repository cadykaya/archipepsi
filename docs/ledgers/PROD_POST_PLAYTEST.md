# Prod — post-playtest repair and interface work (CP0 → CP4, then inherited 0.4)

The governing packet is `post_playtest_v1.0/`, copied verbatim with every
`SHA256SUMS.txt` entry verified. Prod's brief is
`post_playtest_v1.0/dispatch/PROD_START.md`. The task IDs are the
packet's (`13_WORK_QUEUE.md`, `data/WORK_QUEUE.json`).

## CP0 — `H-START` (the reference, preserved)

- **Branch and head:** `claude/archipepsi-0-4-blindside` at `a745637`,
  equal to origin, clean tree. The start is preserved at the NEW ref
  `review/post-playtest-start-a745637`; nothing existing was overwritten.
- **Other lanes:** no commit since the packet. Arty's branch is still
  `4093ded`, and there is no Dess branch.
- **Profile and provider:** the candidate profile
  (`--candidate`, slot `candidate`, folder `.diagnostic-candidate`), with
  the deterministic fallback provider and the mock multiworld. There is
  no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` here.
- **The owner's played save:** not received yet, and not waited for.
  The owner offered to send it; every reproduction below that could use
  it says so.
- **Preflight:** `make godot-import` and `make doctor` pass. The full
  frontier is deliberately not run at CP0.

## The owner's decisions (2026-09-24, verbatim)

**D-06 — legacy saves / enemy persistence.** "Going forward, ordinary
quit/reload should preserve encounter state. Enemies I killed stay dead;
a partially cleared encounter restores the enemies that were still
alive. Reloading is not an encounter-reset event. For an older save that
has no per-enemy persistence data, do not guess that enemies were
killed, and do not respawn the whole encounter around the player at
their saved coordinates. Use any existing authoritative state that
genuinely proves something. Otherwise treat the encounter state as
unknown: reset that room's encounter and restore the player at that
room's safe arrival/checkpoint before enemy AI becomes active. Preserve
the rest of the saved world state. From that point onward the new
enemy-state persistence takes over. In other words: no fabricated
cleared rooms, but also absolutely no legacy-save ambushes."

**D-07 — pressure plates.** "Pressure plates are held sensors. Pressure
present = active. Pressure removed = inactive. A pressure plate must not
permanently latch merely because I stepped on it once. If a puzzle needs
a permanent change, use a visibly different permanent control such as a
lever, locking bolt, latch mechanism, etc. The existing latch machinery
can absolutely be reused underneath — I'm rejecting the
presentation/interaction of a one-shot pressure plate, not the latch
system. If a puzzle genuinely requires a pressure plate to remain
active, there must be a guaranteed physical way to keep pressure on it,
such as a movable object/weight. Do not silently turn the plate into a
toggle. A short timed mechanism may exist as its own clearly
communicated mechanic, but don't disguise permanent or timed state as
'the plate is still pressed.'"

D-08 (the release label for the menu and map) and D-05 (consumable
refill and capacity) stay open. Neither blocks this work.

## Ownership, recorded before any shared edit

The packet gives Dess the new shared schema, progression, fold and save
contracts (`H-RESUME-C`, `H-PRESSURE-C`, `H-RELEASE-C`, `H-UI-DATA`,
`H-MAP-DATA`, `H-SEAMS`). It gives Arty the source art (`H-GLYPH-KIT`,
`H-CIRCUITS`). Neither lane has been resumed, and neither has a commit
since the packet.

The owner approved CP0 → CP4 and decided D-06 and D-07. So Prod takes a
**temporary single-writer exception** for the narrowest shared edits the
approved repairs need:

- each edit is bounded by those rulings and by the accepted contracts;
- each is listed in the seam table below with its source rule, for
  Dess's later review;
- if Dess or Arty resumes, the file in question passes back to them.

Art-dependent work uses clearly provisional placeholder art. It is
never presented as the Glyph-authored final.

## Evidence rules (PROD_START)

- **Every repair has:**
  - a failing reproduction;
  - the changed behaviour;
  - a focused regression and a control;
  - its revision and scope.
- **Combat** uses cumulative events and deaths, and ordinary visible
  aiming.
- **Rooms** are tested hosted in a real candidate, with baseline and
  movement-assisted access, and the return.
- **Resume** kills and relaunches both processes.
- **The menu pause** covers incoming authorizations and input leakage.
