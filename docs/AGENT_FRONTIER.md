# Archipepsi autonomous frontier

This file is the cheap wake-up state. Keep it short and current. Use `NEXT_STEPS.md` for the detailed project/history handoff and the v0.8 packet for authoritative contract details.

## THE ACTIVE FRONTIER: v0.9 — production and the authored-content transition

**`docs/design-packet-v0.9/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is what wake-ups
execute.** S1–S10 (Echoes 2.0) are complete and are history below; the
plan is NOT exhausted.

The governing rule, from `docs/design-packet-v0.8/AUTHORED_CONTENT.md`
(normative, outranks the v0.9 plan): **developers author the alphabet, Godot
enforces the grammar, Epsilon writes sentences.** Epsilon is a composer,
never an asset generator. Do not manufacture "final art" procedurally to
claim a stage. Existing primitive geometry and materials are valid
TESTABLE placeholders and stay. Graybox `.tscn` scenes are legitimate
deliverables and must say in-file that they are not final art.

Dependency order (S21/S22 are independent of the asset pipeline, and are
the work that continues if an art gate blocks the rest):

```
S11  CI                        ── independent, first
S12  registry + asset contract ── the foundation S13-S19 consume
 ├── S13 instantiation pipeline
 │     ├── S14 Hub + Echo Lab migration
 │     ├── S15 room shells + connectors ── S16 encounter/traversal vocabulary
 │     ├── S17 interactable/presentation contracts
 │     └── S18 enemy/player/affordance visual interfaces
 └── S19 material/VFX/audio/lighting registries
S20  campaign spine (human-decision gates)
S21  settings/input/a11y       ── INDEPENDENT
S22  packaging/first-run       ── mostly independent
S23  release hardening         ── last
```

**Stage status:**

| Stage | State |
|---|---|
| S11 CI | **done** — three tiers green on real runners; `docs/CI.md` |
| S12 registry + asset contract | **done** — `schemas/content.py`, `content_registry.gd`, `docs/ART_ASSET_SPEC.md`, `make godot-content` |
| S13 instantiation pipeline | **done** — `content_instantiator.gd`, routed from `ZoneBuilder` |
| S14 Hub + Echo Lab migration | **done** — `hub_anchors.gd`, Lab gap pinned |
| S15 room shells + connectors | **grammar done; shells BLOCKED on Q1** |
| S16 encounter/traversal vocabulary | **done** — tower ascent bounded, gap bound exported |
| S17 interactable/presentation contracts | **done** — `interactable_contract.gd` |
| S18 enemy/player/affordance visual interfaces | **done** — `visual_interface.gd` |
| S19 material/VFX/audio/lighting vocabularies | **done** — `test_epsilon_vocabulary.py` |
| S21 settings/input/a11y | **done** — `player_settings.gd` |
| S22 packaging/first-run | **done** — `make doctor`, secrets tests |
| S20 campaign spine | **hooks built; BLOCKED on Q3** (narrative) |
| S23 release hardening | **done** — `AUTOMATION_LIMITS.md` |

S22 added `make doctor` (a fresh-clone preflight that separates
REQUIRED from optional — no API key is reported as fine, because the
fallback provider is what a player without one plays) and the secrets
tests: no tracked file may contain a key-shaped string, `.env` must be
ignored AND git must agree, and no third-party binary may be tracked
without a licensing decision (Q2).

S21 holds two rules: a preference is never campaign truth (asserted
against `CampaignSnapshot` and `CampaignSave` by reading the preference
names out of the GDScript, so the two cannot drift), and rebinding can
never leave a base-kit action unbound — a player who unbinds `jump` has
made their own seed unfinishable, in a menu, three rooms from the gap.
A hand-edited config is repaired rather than obeyed.

S19 enforces "Epsilon is a composer, never an asset generator"
STRUCTURALLY rather than by review: every string field of every model
Epsilon authors must be a closed vocabulary, a charset that cannot spell
a path, or allowlisted prose with a stated reason. A new free-text field
fails the test until someone says what it is for — which is the moment
to notice it is a filename. `concepts`, `tags`, `subject` and
`scaled_by` gained charset patterns; `res://x.tscn` is twelve characters
and fitted comfortably inside a 24-character free string.

S18 proved a visual swap cannot move a hitbox: every archetype built
under all six themes must produce byte-identical collision, and the
archetypes must differ from each other so that check cannot pass by
everything being one box. Two different rules, because procedural and
authored geometry fail differently — `_box` derives mesh and collider
from one `size` (so they must AGREE), while an authored scene has a
person on each side (so art must not carry collision at all).

S17's "do not leak hidden scouting information" was ALREADY enforced
where it matters: the bridge does not send item identity for an
unrevealed location (`ScoutedLocation._unrevealed_withholds_identity`),
tested in Python since the v0.4 review. S17 added the client-side half —
the client legitimately knows some item names (a shop-stocked location
is revealed), so a pedestal reading `scout.item_name` without checking
state would spoil exactly the Checks the player paid to learn about —
plus a readability rule: no two AP states may share both their words and
their colour.

S16 found and fixed a real I3/I4 inconsistency: the tower's spiral asked
for a 2.4 m mandatory jump at a 1.0 m rise, where the safe bound is 2.0 m
— the same bound the schema enforces on Epsilon's `platform_path`. The
engine was breaking a rule it imposes. `max_safe_gap` is now EXPORTED to
GDScript as a function, so a builder placing a raised platform can ask
instead of typing a number, and the tower's spacing is derived from it.
The tower suite now measures the built ascent rather than inferring it.

**Open question Q1 (`docs/design-packet-v0.9/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`) blocks
graybox archetype shells.** Every chamber archetype carries continuous
generator-chosen dimensions and a `.tscn` is a fixed size; for
`platform_path` the schema's `gap_size <= SAFE_BASE_JUMP_GAP` bound is
how I3/I4 are enforced today, and a baked gap escapes it. The connector
grammar half of S15 is done and shipped. Do NOT author archetype shells
before Q1 is answered — doing so silently picks option C.

S14 put a named anchor contract between the Hub's logic and its
geometry: logic asks for `main_portal` or `shop`, `HubAnchors` decides
where that is, from the procedural defaults or from an authored scene's
markers. Adoption is per-anchor, so a graybox Hub can replace the room
one marker at a time. The Echo Lab's gap width is now a documented
constant pinned between `SAFE_BASE_JUMP_GAP` and `JUMP_FLAT_REACH` --
both bounds are silent failures if they break.

S13 routed every chamber through the registry, and every route still
ends at `ChamberBuilders` because every entry is still a declared
placeholder. That is the design: the generator is now the documented last
resort rather than the only path, so an authored shell can replace one at
a time without a flag day. A test pins the placeholder route to produce
exactly what calling the builder directly produces.

S12 landed the alphabet's shape, not the alphabet: everything in
`godot/content/registry/legacy_procedural.json` is `procedural_fallback:
true`, which is the registry stating honestly that it is generated
geometry. That is the correct state — the game is READY TO RECEIVE
authored content, and has none yet.

Conventions fixed by the spec but not yet wired (each marked "Not wired
yet" in `ART_ASSET_SPEC.md`, and each is a later stage's job, not debt):
material slot names → themed materials (S19), animation clip names →
interactable contracts (S17), manifest `cost` → a placement budget.

**Heartbeat behaviour: STOP. Every independently implementable stage is
done, and the owner's 2026-08-28 decisions
(`docs/design-packet-v0.9/OWNER_DECISIONS.md`) closed Q1, Q2 and Q3.**

Implemented since: the ending and postgame (D3), authored-shell semantic
authority with Godot measuring physical truth (D1), the asset licence
gate and notices (D2), the tier presentation arc (D4), visual layer
ownership (D6), and the art-lane review gate.

What remains needs a person, not more iteration
(`AUTOMATION_LIMITS.md`):

1. **Authored art** — the art lane is in STYLE LOCK 001-R and its assets
   are NOT approved. A file existing in the tree is not permission:
   `review: pending` entries are refused by the instantiator, and only
   `pass` ships. Do not recreate the art lane's work or choose between
   pending variants.
2. **Final writing** — the completion beat and postgame lines are
   placeholders in the established voice and say so in the source. D3
   fixed the structure and left the words open.
3. **Human playtesting** — every statable invariant has a test. Whether
   the game is GOOD is not among them.
4. **`challenge_marker`** — deliberately deferred. The hook stays
   dormant and is not removed; a test refuses anything depending on it.
5. **Project code licensing** — separate from asset intake, and not
   decided.

Wake-ups are no-ops except for concrete regressions or CI failures. Do
NOT invent a new roadmap or speculative work to fill a heartbeat.
