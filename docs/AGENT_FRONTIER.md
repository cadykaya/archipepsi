# Archipepsi autonomous frontier

This file is the cheap wake-up state. Keep it short and current. Use `NEXT_STEPS.md` for the detailed project/history handoff and the v0.8 packet for authoritative contract details.

## Current frontier
- Branch: `claude/archipepsi-build-inzshp`
- v0.7 POC: complete
- Echoes 2.0 S1 + S1.1 + S2 + S3: complete
- S4: complete — the ECHOES §5 rule interpreter (`rule_runtime.gd`,
  `make godot-rules`, I5 proven: edge latches, deferral, cooldown-bounded
  oscillation, per-tick cap, cost atomicity, alias resolution); fold
  validates rule resource references (I11 treatment); capability gate
  opened `rule` with per-piece §5 allowlist gates; game-event wiring
  (incl. new chamber tracking); fallback grants a FLASK (low_health
  auto-heal rule) and a kill-fed CELL (self-discharging shield rule); I8
  proven and the fallback is budget-aware; integration asserts the
  campaign ends owning folded resources AND rules.
- S5: complete — the nine-stat derived stack with I3's floors
  (`stat_stack.gd`, `make godot-stats`), per-target statuses
  (`status_effects.gd`), all four link kinds walking in the runner, the
  last six verbs (`beam_sustained`/`hover`/`block`/`restore_resource`/
  `scan_mark`/`cleanse`), I7 enforced by the trait model, and the
  §5 status rule vocabulary. Both S3 tripwires discharged.
- S6: complete — the operation vocabulary is whole. The capability
  gate admits `upgrade`/`modify`/`merge`; `target_errors` checks a
  disposition can land at GENERATION (repair loop) as well as at fold
  (I11); the request carries the owned component graph with per-field
  upgrade headroom; the fallback evolves families (ECHOES §11's own
  Hookshot→Longshot→Clawshot example is reachable from
  `--epsilon=fallback`); I10 alias soundness proven; §12 identity
  packages complete (sound family, particle style) and pinned from both
  sides.
- S7: **complete** — four slots, four runtimes, four keys (RMB / MMB+F /
  Shift / C). `IMPLEMENTED_ACTION_SLOTS` is the whole contract;
  `SLOT_NAMES` shared through `constants.py`; the S1.1 `ARCHETYPE_SLOT`
  collapse retired (migrated mobility Echoes go back to Shift); the HUD
  shows all four slots with Mk levels; the archive names the key each
  button lands on, compares against what it would replace, and marks
  favourites (client preference, `user://loadout.cfg`, never campaign
  state); the wheel cycles favourites within the highlighted slot.
- **Next: S8 the Echo Lab** (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §2.5): the Hub test
  chamber that grows with the vocabulary. NOTE: ChatGPT/GPT-5.6 Sol
  prepared S8 design notes and traps on a separate branch — read and
  cherry-pick before starting, but the v0.8 packet and the live
  interfaces win over anything written ahead of the code.

## Stage dependency trap
`pull_pickup` is the ONLY verb still deferred: it collects local rewards, which are S9. `DEFERRED_PRIMITIVES` must name the last required stage, not the first.

## Standing tripwires (deliberate, will fire on stage advance)
- `test_stage_tripwires.py` now guards the S9 boundary (affordances and
  Info readouts); its docstring names the work due when it fires. The two
  S3-era tripwires fired at S5 and were paid — that test is their receipt.
- Cross-language pins: glyph indices, palette names, channel count
  (`test_hud_contract.py` ↔ `hud_driver.gd`), theme rule
  (`test_theme_agreement.py` ↔ `integration_driver.gd`), runner arms
  (`test_runner_coverage.py`).

## Resolved at S5 (was the standing unresolved decision)
Traits apply because they are OWNED — unchanged, and now deliberate
rather than inherited. S5 added the escape hatch the contract always
intended: `requires_equipped` makes a trait conditional on a slot, and
I7 now *requires* it for any severe downside (enforced by the trait
model, not merely described). Ownership is the default; equipping is the
modifier. Recorded in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_DECISIONS.md` (S5).

## Last full green verification
At S7 completion (this commit):
- `make test`: 286 passed
- `check_packet.py`: green, 10 docs
- `make godot-test`: GODOT CHAMBER TESTS OK
- `make godot-blink`: 5125 resolved / 17825 refused; GODOT BLINK TESTS OK
- `make godot-hud`: GODOT HUD TESTS OK
- `make godot-rules`: GODOT RULES TESTS OK
- `make godot-stats`: GODOT STATS TESTS OK (I3 sweep, links, S7 slots)
- `make godot-integration`: GODOT INTEGRATION OK, full 12-zone campaign;
  every interpretation credited in some provenance chain, 7 components at
  Mk II+, longest chain 4 items, Actions reaching 3 of the 4 slots

Do not assume these counts remain current after new commits; update this section only after the corresponding suites actually run green.

## Core invariants
AP integrity > save integrity > deterministic campaign state > playable integration > polish.

Archipelago owns randomized truth. Python owns campaign/allocation/save/fold truth. Epsilon owns presentation/creative structured interpretation only. Godot renders/simulates and sends player intents. Persistent state changes go through transitions. Mechanics are derived from the interpretation log and never persisted as a second truth. Preserve base-kit solvability.
