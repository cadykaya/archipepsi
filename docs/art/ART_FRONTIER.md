# ART FRONTIER — where the art lane is, right now

**Read this first on every heartbeat.** It is the cheap wake-up state for
the Archipepsi art lane. Everything else in `docs/art/` is reference; this
file is the only one that says what to *do next*.

## THE GATE

> ## BATCH 001-R IS AWAITING OWNER REVIEW.
> ## MASS ASSET PRODUCTION IS STILL BLOCKED.

Batch 001 came back **PASS WITH REVISIONS** and the owner asked for one
revision batch, not production. 001-R is that batch. The gate has **not**
moved: after 001-R, stop at the review gate again.

**Only the owner turns `PENDING` into `PASS` in
[`ART_REVIEW.md`](ART_REVIEW.md).** No entry there may be moved by anyone
else, for any reason, including "it obviously passes".

### Until the owner has reviewed, a heartbeat MAY

- fix objective pipeline failures — a broken build, export or import
- fix defects in the review tooling itself
- re-render evidence that has gone stale
- fill out `ASSET_INVENTORY.md` or the other packet documents
- record a lesson in `ART_LESSONS.md`
- correct something that **objectively** violates a written rule in
  `ART_BIBLE.md` (a budget overrun, a density out of band, an asset outside
  its collider, an enemy wearing the theme's colours)

### Until the owner has reviewed, a heartbeat MAY NOT

- declare any visual concept approved
- silently pick one of three concepts
- extrapolate an unapproved concept into more assets
- delete a rejected alternative
- start theme production — the three unbuilt themes stay unbuilt
- start final Hub or Echo Lab modelling
- expand the asset count for any reason

**If there is nothing objective left to do, say so in one line, leave this
file accurate, and end the turn.** Do not invent work to fill a heartbeat.

## Status

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Branch | `claude/archipepsi-art`, based on `claude/archipepsi-build-inzshp` |
| Phase | **Batch 001-R built and rendered.** Batch 001 reviewed; its verdict and the owner's selections are recorded in `ART_REVIEW.md`. |
| Owner review | **001-R REQUESTED — not yet received.** Draft PR [#5](https://github.com/cadykaya/archipepsi/pull/5). |
| Next action | **Wait.** The gate above is the whole of the current instruction. |

### What the Batch 001 review settled

- **The contrast.** Facility = cold grey abandoned research lab. Epsilon =
  alien intrusion, neon green, embedded into it. `ART_BIBLE.md` §1a.
- **Selections:** Epsilon **B**, Check **A**, Portal **B** as direction,
  Anchor **A** primary with **B** kept, and all three enemy concepts kept
  and reinterpreted as **melee / ranged / brute**.
- **Nothing was deleted.** Unselected concepts are `KEPT`.

### Objective state, last verified

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 tools/blender/engine_truth.py` | PASS |
| `python3 tools/blender/palette.py` | PASS |
| `python3 tools/blender/check_docs_metrics.py` | PASS — every number in ART_REVIEW.md and ASSET_INVENTORY.md matches the build |
| `tools/sabotage_checks.sh` | PASS — 19/19 |
| `tools/check_art_current.sh` | PASS — every asset byte-identical from source |
| Assets built | 29 models + 16 theme textures + 46 review images |
| Composed room | 3,272 / 12,000 triangles |

### What a heartbeat cannot see

The hourly routine stores no MCP connectors, so a heartbeat session runs
**without `mcp__github__*` tools** — and `curl` against the GitHub API is
unauthenticated in this sandbox and returns an empty check-run list rather
than an error. A heartbeat therefore **cannot read CI status**, and a poll
loop built on `curl` would report silence forever, which looks exactly like
"still running".

So: a heartbeat does not chase CI. PR events wake the interactive session
directly, and that is where CI is judged. If a heartbeat needs to know, it
should say it cannot rather than guess.

## Where the review images are

**[`docs/art/review/batch001/`](review/batch001/)**

| Prefix | What |
| --- | --- |
| `A_epsilon_b_core` | **the revised intrusion** (A and C kept, unrevised) |
| `B_check_a_pedestal` | **the revised signal mast** (B and C kept) |
| `C_portal_b_collar` | **the revised breach** (A kept) |
| `D_enemy_lineup_*` | **all three archetypes in one frame at 18 m** — lit, silhouette, clay |
| `D_enemy_{melee,ranged,brute}_*` | the three individual sheets |
| `E_anchor_a_soffit` | primary; `E_anchor_b_jib` kept as a variant |
| `F_arch_*` | 9 modules, including the new `wall_ribbed` |
| `G_prop_*` | 7 props, re-toned off the base ramp |
| `H_material_*` | 3 theme sheets; `concrete_facility` now has 6 roles |
| `H_probe_*_room` | **in-engine theme probes** — void_glitch (requested) and rusted_industrial |
| `I_room_*` | the revised room — wide, greyscale, near, warm-light proposal, and each Check in the same spot |

Start with `I_room_wide.png` and `I_room_greyscale.png`. They answer whether
the pieces make a place, which is the question the other 31 sheets cannot.

## Rebuild and re-render, in full

```sh
B=.tools/blender/blender
for s in materials architecture props concept_epsilon concept_check \
         concept_portal concept_enemy concept_anchor; do
  $B -b --python tools/blender/build_$s.py
done
tools/batch001_sheets.sh      # ~12 min: 28 sheets
tools/composed_room.sh        # ~1 min: 6 room captures
tools/check_art_current.sh    # includes the document-metric check
tools/sabotage_checks.sh      # refuses to run against a dirty tree
```

Toolchains are fetched per session into `.tools/` (gitignored) — see
`ASSET_AUTHORING.md` §1. Blender **4.5.9 LTS**, Godot **4.5.1 stable
(f62fdbde1)**.

## Open interface requirements — engineering's, not ours

Documented rather than invented. Nothing in Batch 001 depends on any of
them; each is a thing the art lane will need when contracts settle.

| # | Requirement | Why | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **An asset registry keyed by stable asset ID**, mapping ID → resource path + anchor + footprint + category. Epsilon selects an ID; Godot resolves it. **Epsilon never sees a path.** | An Epsilon that can name a resource path can name any file. | All integration |
| 2 | **Editor import settings preserving NEAREST with mipmaps.** The bench proves the *runtime* GLTF path keeps the sampler; the *editor* import path is a different code path and is untested. | An authored asset importing with linear filtering makes the authored/procedural seam the most visible thing in the room. | Integration |
| 3a | **A warm `light_color` for `concrete_facility`.** The owner's facility direction asks for yellow utility lighting; `THEME_MATERIALS` says `#eaf2ff`, a cool white. `I_room_warmlight_proposal.png` shows the difference. Art did not change it — the anchor is engineering's. | The facility reads clinical rather than institutional-warm. | owner decision, then a one-line engine change |
| 3 | **A decision on `TEXTURE_SIZE_MAX` for imported assets.** 128 bounds the runtime generator. Batch 001 stays under it so nothing depends on the answer. | The deferred first-person viewmodel tier needs 256. | `viewmodel_*` |
| 4 | **A footprint contract for the Epsilon presence.** `hub.gd` has a generic 2.0 × 3.0 × 0.8 m terminal and no dedicated fixture. | The three concepts are built inside that envelope on every axis, so whichever contract lands they fit. | `hub_epsilon_presence` |
| 5 | **A larger footprint, or an L2 placement path, for composed clusters.** `PROP_FOOTPRINT` is 1.4 m. | Right for L0, too small for an L2 station or storytelling cluster. | `cluster_*` |
| 6 | **`challenge_marker` world semantics** (`AGENT_FRONTIER.md` still lists this open). | Its visual cannot be specified until its meaning is. | `local_reward_pickup` |

**Do not edit gameplay logic to make an asset convenient. Do not alter a
mechanical dimension to make an asset prettier.** Collision and traversal
truth remain Godot's.

## Known gaps, stated plainly

- **void_glitch may be too loud.** The in-engine probe is the evidence. My
  read: the floor works, the walls and ceiling at full-saturation magenta do
  not. Flagged in `ART_REVIEW.md` with a proposed fix; the owner decides.
- **Nothing is rigged or animated.** A telegraph is a promise
  (`AUTHORED_CONTENT.md`), and a promise cannot be judged from a static
  model. This is the next large question after style approval — not before.
- **Three themes are unbuilt.** `neon_transit`, `gothic_stone`,
  `temple_ruin` are inventoried and behind this gate.
- **Only `concrete_facility` has a room shot.** The other two probes exist
  as texture sheets only.
- **The review sheets are Compatibility-renderer captures**, so every one is
  a lower bound on the owner's Forward+ build.
- **`prop_*` reads blue in `concrete_facility`**, because props paint from
  the theme accent and that accent is `#4f6f8f` in `THEME_MATERIALS`. A
  faithful consequence of engine truth, flagged in `ART_REVIEW.md` because
  it is the most likely thing to feel wrong on sight.

## After approval — the order, when the gate opens

Not before. Written down so the first post-approval heartbeat does not have
to decide it.

1. Fold the owner's 001-R notes into `ART_BIBLE.md` and `ART_LESSONS.md`.
2. Finish the selected concepts; the kept alternatives stay in the repo.
3. Complete the remaining three theme material families.
4. Complete the architecture kit (§6 of `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`).
5. Room shells (§7) — the level that stops Epsilon obviously repeating one
   room.
6. Remaining enemy archetypes and their telegraphs, which is where rigging
   becomes unavoidable.
7. The remaining six affordance fixtures.
8. Hub and Echo Lab — last, because they are the largest and the least
   forgiving, and because everything else teaches us how to build them.
